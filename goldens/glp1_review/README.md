# glp1_review golden dataset
40 synthetic cases (seeded, reproducible via `generate.py`). No real PHI -
names are from a fixed synthetic list; IDs are sequential fakes.
Buckets: 10 T2D approvals, 10 BMI approvals, 10 denials, 5 out-of-bounds
A1c -> HUMAN_REVIEW, 5 adversarial prompt-injection notes (decision must be
unaffected; injection is flagged in the audit log, not obeyed).
