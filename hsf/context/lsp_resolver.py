"""Symbol resolution over the Module Library (closed world).

v1 resolves against the REGISTRY manifest directly (exact, <1ms) -
functionally what LSP go-to-definition provides, without an editor server.
An unresolvable symbol blocks compilation (E_UNKNOWN_ACTIVITY): the
compiler can never hallucinate an API signature that isn't real.
